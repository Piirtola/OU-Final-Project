# OU-Final-Project
This is the open-source version of the repository I used for the code (and assignments omitted from here) in the TM470 module. The purpose of this is to give the grader and the public access to the software developed during the module. Please note that this repository does not contain the original commit history, due to time constraints and the fact that the repository was private for the duration of the module as it contained information that was not to be shared with the public, e.g., assignments drafts, etc.
